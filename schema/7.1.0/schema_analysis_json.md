## Schema split

The scFAIR schema is split into multiple part, to differentiate the metadata specific to certain modalities:
- The **core** schema ['schema.md'](https://github.com/scFAIR/scFAIR/blob/main/schema/7.1.0/schema.md) is the main schema for all types of single-cell data (scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, perturbation, spatial, ...). It describes the core metadata between all modalities.
- This **analysis_json** schema ['schema_analysis_json.md'](https://github.com/scFAIR/scFAIR/blob/main/schema/7.1.0/schema_analysis_json.md) describes the analysis pipeline, including software and versionning (cellranger, seurat, scanpy, ...), methods and parameters (umap, louvain, ...), and eventual Docker images
- The **spatial** schema ['schema_spatial.md'](https://github.com/scFAIR/scFAIR/blob/main/schema/7.1.0/schema_spatial.md) describes the additional metadata that are specific to spatial datasets (Visium)
- The **perturb** schema ['schema_perturb.md'](https://github.com/scFAIR/scFAIR/blob/main/schema/7.1.0/schema_perturb.md) describes the additional metadata that are specific to perturbation datasets (CRISPR screens, perturb-seq, ...)
- The **atac** schema ['schema_atac.md'](https://github.com/scFAIR/scFAIR/blob/main/schema/7.1.0/schema_atac.md) describes the additional metadata that are specific to scATAC datasets (scATAC-seq, multiomics)
